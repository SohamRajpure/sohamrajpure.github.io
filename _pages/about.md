I am an undergraduate at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) with a strong interest in distributed inference for large model deployments because of its potential to lower the cost of AI, thereby broadening its scope and accessibility.

I am currently exploring ideas about caching strategies for inference and optimistically looking into out-of-order generation of anchor tokens within a window as a form of speculative decoding. 

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking and spending time outdoors.

I am eager to get involved with research projects focused on systems for AI. Please feel free to reach out to me via any of the contact methods listed at the bottom of this page!
