I'm interested in robotics and how machine learning can help us bring it to tackling problems in the real world. Long term, I'd like to play a part in making work a choice. Currently I'm playing around with representation learning and hierarchial RL as it applies to robotic manipulation.

I also love fencing! At my best, I've been ranked 43rd in the World for Men's Foil and I'm currently trying to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics - though Coronavirus has made that complicated! I've just graduated from Sydney University in Mechatronic (Space) Engineering, where I was advised by Ian Manchester and Stefan Williams. During my degree I spent a year split between Beijing and Hong Kong during which I studied at Tsinghua University on a New Colombo Scholarship, and interned at Zeroth.AI (a VC firm) and JD.com (China's analogue to Amazon). In Sydney I've interned at the Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ACFR).  

If you're ever in Sydney drop me a message at any of the contacts at the bottom of the page!
